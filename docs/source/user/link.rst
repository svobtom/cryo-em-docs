Access Link
===========

After scanning the sample is complete the user receives an e-mail with information how to download the desired data.
The message contains a link to Onedata web interface where the scanned files can be browsed.
Whoever has the link, he/she can also access the data, no login is required.

.. todo:: 

This is a general security problem, the link should expire in some short period, login should be required then

The web interface is convenient for a quick overview and access to individual files, however, it becomes 
cumbersome to download dozens or even hundreds of files. See the next section for a batch download optinon.
